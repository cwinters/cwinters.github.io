My name is Chris Winters. I'm married to Barbara Alsko 
and we have one kid (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/tags/ella/">Ella</a>)
and two cats. I currently work at <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/">ModCloth</a>
as a software developer, and you can find out more boring
work-related stuff at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/winterschris">LinkedIn</a>.

You can get a good idea of what I've been into online by
[following my Pinboard feed](http://pinboard.in/u:cwinters), which
holds bookmarks I've been accumulating since about 2004.

Things I'm more or less into in real life:

* Being a dad
* Vegetable gardening
* Keeping up with technology stuff, including feed reading (via
  [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/)) and meeting up
  with various Pittsburgh groups -- I'm almost always at the Ruby
  and Go meetings.
* Reading (fiction and comic books are the consumables right now)
* Bicycling
* Catching up with Doctor Who
* Running ([very slowly](http://results.active.com/events/dicks-sporting-goods-pittsburgh-marathon/participants?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=winters&commit=Search))
