My name is Chris Winters. I'm married to Barbara Alsko
and we have one kid ([Ella](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/tags/ella/))
and two cats. I currently work at
[Turnitin](http://www.turnitin.com) as a software developer and engineering
manager, and you can find out more boring work-related stuff at
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/winterschris).

You can get a good idea of what I've been into online by
[following my Pinboard feed](http://pinboard.in/u:cwinters), which
holds bookmarks I've been accumulating since about 2004.

Things I'm more or less into in real life:

* Being a dad
* Vegetable gardening
* Keeping up with technology stuff, including feed reading (via
  [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/)) and meeting up
  with various Pittsburgh groups -- I have frequently haunted the Ruby
  and Go meetings, sometimes JavaScript and probably more Python coming up.
* Reading (fiction and comic books are the consumables right now)
* Running ([fairly slowly](http://results.xacte.com/?id=1144&tagcode=3499))
* Bicycling
