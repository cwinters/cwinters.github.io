## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Writing up some remote work guidelines for our engineering teams, and trying
  to find a good balance between recommendation and perscription.
* Leaning into improving our QA processes and tools. A lot of this would fall
  in the realm of "DevOps stuff" and I'm wary of becoming a Local Jenkins
  Expert. But tool building is pretty satisfying, as is (hopefully) leveling up
  multiple disparate teams.
* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* Sheltering in place and washing so many hands, like everyone. (RIGHT?)
* [Making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh)
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires
* Canceling everything related to our 20th anniversary trip :-(  We'll get to
  London and Ireland next year, hopefully.
