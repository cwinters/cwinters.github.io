## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* I got a [new bike](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special) in late
  March from excellent local bike shop [Thick Bikes](https://thickbikes.com/)
  and am super happy with it so far. The last bike I got was in 2006, hopefully
  this one will last as long. I also got an
  [indoor bike trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr)
  early this year and have been really digging it. (Also kicking myself for not
  getting it earlier...)
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.

__Work__

* Three months in at [the US Digital Service](https://usds.gov/) on June 21 and
  it's going great. I think. Onboarding and working entirely remotely has been
  more difficult than I anticipated. But the mission is amazing and the people
  I work with are among the best of my entire career. Really inspiring, and
  quite humbling.
