## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* We're going on a trip! The 20th anniversary trip we were going to take in
  May 2020 is happening in a couple months. We're still going to London and
  Ireland, but since it's shorter it'll really only be London and Dublin.
* I got a [new bike](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special) last year
  from excellent local bike shop [Thick Bikes](https://thickbikes.com/)
  and am super happy with it so far. The last bike I got was in 2006, hopefully
  this one will last as long. I also got an
  [indoor bike trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr)
  and have been really digging it. (Also kicking myself for not
  getting it earlier...)
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to live with a teenager (now 15!) and the roller-coaster emotions
  she contains and inspires.

__Work__

* Six months in at [the US Digital Service](https://usds.gov/) and it's going
  great. I think. Onboarding and working entirely remotely has been more
  difficult than I anticipated. But the mission is amazing (currently working
  with the CDC helping to run operations for [this project](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/))
  and the people I work with are among the best of my entire career. Really
  inspiring, and quite humbling.
