## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* Preparing for a Pittsburgh-to-Washington DC bike ride in early June.
  I got a [new bike](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special) recently from excellent
  local bike shop [Thick Bikes](https://thickbikes.com/) and am super happy
  with it so far. The last bike I got was in 2006, hopefully this one will last
  as long. I also got an
  [indoor bike trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr)
  a few months ago and have been really digging it.
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.

__Work__

* Change is a-coming -- my last day at Turnitin was May 21!
* More soon on what's coming next -- but it's a big switch, and I'm really
  excited!
