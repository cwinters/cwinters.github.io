## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* I'm trying to get Irish citizenship through my grandmother, who was born
  in Belfast. It's tricky because she was adopted, and at the time (1925) adoptions
  weren't recorded by the government, so while I have a bunch of surrounding
  documentation -- including what I'm 95% sure is her birth certificate -- I'm
  missing a step linking that birth to her adopted family.
* Ella is in college! Surprisingly she's nearby, and it was a very mature
  decision of her to choose the strength of the program vs desire to live
  elsewhere. Doing great so far.
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.

__Work__

* Now working at [Diamond Kinetics](https://sidelinehd.com) as a Lead
  Software Engineer! I'm reaping some rewards of working well with people over the years,
  and it's a lot of architecture improvement while still keeping everything running. I'm
  working with some new technologies -- Firebase, Google App Engine -- which are fine, but
  some of my old tricks don't work with them.
* I'm not onboard the AI coding train. Partially because it's change, partially because it's
  just wrong for a lot of my work (making sense of some spaghetti), and partially because
  coding is how I think about solving problems, and I can't just skip over the thinking step.
  That may be a failing of mine, but it is what it is.
