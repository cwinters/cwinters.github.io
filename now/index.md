## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning how to not solve problems with code but instead inspring others to
  do so.
* Recruiting! The Pittsburgh Turnitin office has three engineering positions
  open -- [check them out](http://turnitin.com/en_us/about-us/careers#openings)
  and [let me know](https://twitter.com/cwinters) if you're interested.
* Upcoming travel:
    * None: woohoo!

__Life__

* Running better. I've half-assed some longer runs in the past, which is
  probably a bad idea for someone my age. And I've gone through a couple years of:
  train train train in the months before an event, then slack off in the months
  after and lose progress. Trying to be more consistent.
