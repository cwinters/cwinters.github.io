## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning how to not solve problems with code but instead inspring others to
  do so. Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects and
  thinking a quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple
  different teams.
* [Making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh)
* Learning to live with a teenager (even though she's 12) and the
  roller-coaster emotions she contains and inspires

__Life__

* Riding my bike as much as possible (translated: "until the weather gets
  crappy"), usually on the Montour or Panhandle Trails. But I also went up to
  the Allegheny River Trail in July and really dug it.
