## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to play guitar! Just got it in December, struggling through making
  my fingers do different things.
* Adapting our new-ish kitten to the house. (Or maybe it's the reverse...)
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Waiting for Spring so I can ride my bike outside again; also waiting for a
  [modern indoor trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr/buy)
  to get back in stock.
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.
