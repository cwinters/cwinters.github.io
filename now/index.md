## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning how to not solve problems with code but instead inspring others to
  do so. Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects and
  thinking a quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple
  different teams.
* [Making lots of bread](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh)

* Upcoming travel:
    * March 25-29, Oakland, Calif.
