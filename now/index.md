## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* We got a dog! [Rosie](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYxci6yt13l/) is a Golden
  Retriever and is just over a year old. She's very smart, loves people, and
  also enjoys eating anything that will fit in her mouth -- garbage, rocks,
  cardboard, cat poop, etc.
* I got a [new bike](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special) last year
  from excellent local bike shop [Thick Bikes](https://thickbikes.com/)
  and am super happy with it so far. The last bike I got was in 2006, hopefully
  this one will last as long. I also got an
  [indoor bike trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr)
  and have been really digging it. (Also kicking myself for not
  getting it earlier...)
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to live with a teenager (now 15!) and the roller-coaster emotions
  she contains and inspires.

__Work__

* Now working at [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org) as a Senior
  Software Engineer! I'm excited about the mission around food waste and the
  improvements it can inspire all through the food chain. I'm also
  tempermentally suited for small orgs, really missed working with people, and
  am super into getting back to building mode.
