## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Updating our [amazing app](https://revisionassistant.com) to work with
  Python3. Finally time.
* Leaning into improving our QA processes and tools. A lot of this would fall
  in the realm of "DevOps stuff" and I'm wary of becoming a Local Jenkins
  Expert. But tool building is pretty satisfying, as is (hopefully) leveling up
  multiple disparate teams.
* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* [Making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh)
* Summertime means bike time. Preferred trails are the Panhandle and Montour.
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires
