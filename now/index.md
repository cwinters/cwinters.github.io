## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning how to not solve problems with code but instead inspring others to
  do so. Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects and
  thinking a quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple
  different teams.
* Upcoming travel:
    * September 16-21, Oakland, Calif.

__Life__

* Riding my bike. I've been riding one or two times pretty consistently all
  summer and it's been pretty great. I love riding way more than running, even
  though there's more preparation.
