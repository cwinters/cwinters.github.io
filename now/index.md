## What I'm doing now

__Life__

* Recovering from a Pittsburgh-to-Washington DC bike ride from June 1 - June 6.
  [See instagram](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh) for details and photos.
  For the most part it was great, but I had one bad day due to a sloppy trail
  (from rain the day before), plus a leaky tube and not being able to get the
  tire off the rim to change it. Eventually it worked out, and I got another
  real-world example of how helpful random people can be.
* I got a [new bike](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special) recently from excellent
  local bike shop [Thick Bikes](https://thickbikes.com/) and am super happy
  with it so far. The last bike I got was in 2006, hopefully this one will last
  as long. I also got an
  [indoor bike trainer](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-trainers/kickr)
  a few months ago and have been really digging it.
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.

__Work__

* My last day at Turnitin was May 21! I'll be starting at
  [the US Digital Service](https://usds.gov/) on June 21. I don't know what
  projects I'll be on yet, but I'm really excited!
