## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning about being a manager and the different growing pains a very small
  organization feels when growing into a slightly larger one.
* Monitoring, supporting, and scaling Docker with
  [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
* Breaking down a small-but-monolithic application into microservices

__Life__

* [Odyssey of the Mind](http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/). Barb and I are
  coaching a team at Washington Elementary for the first time.
* Exercising regularly. I recently joined the Y and go to the
  [PNC](http://www.ymcaofpittsburgh.org/locations/pnc-ymca/) branch three days
  a week, modulo weird events.
* Running better. I've half-assed some longer runs in the past, which is
  probably a bad idea for someone my age. Initial results are good - I recently
  cut a [minute-per-mile](http://results.xacte.com/?id=1144&tagcode=3499) off my
  previous two outings. But I still have loads of room for improvement.
