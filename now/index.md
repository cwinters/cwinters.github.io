## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Leaning into improving our QA processes and tools. A lot of this would fall
  in the realm of "DevOps stuff" and I'm wary of becoming a Local Jenkins
  Expert. But tool building is pretty satisfying, as is (hopefully) leveling up
  multiple disparate teams.
* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* [Making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh)
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires
* Exercising at least twice a week. Nothing dramatic, just trying to keep up
  with age, maybe hold it at bay for a while.
* Planning a trip to London and Ireland for our 20th wedding anniversary.
