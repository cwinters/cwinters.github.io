## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning how to not solve problems with code but instead inspring others to
  do so.
* Recruiting! The Pittsburgh Turnitin office has three engineering positions
  opening soon, [let me know](https://twitter.com/cwinters) if you're interested.
* Upcoming travel:
    * 24-Nov - 27-Nov: New York City Thanksgiving holiday vacation
    * 28-Nov - 2-Dec: Las Vegas, [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
    * 5-Dec - 9-Dec: Oakland, CA talking with folks at Turnitin World HQ

__Life__

* Running better. I've half-assed some longer runs in the past, which is
  probably a bad idea for someone my age. And I've gone through a couple years of:
  train train train in the months before an event, then slack off in the months
  after and lose progress. Trying to be more consistent.
