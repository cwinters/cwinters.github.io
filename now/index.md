## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* We just (today!) got a new kitten!
* Summertime means [bike time](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31922104).
  Preferred trails are the Panhandle and Montour.
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Bummed about missing two vacations this year: a standard summer beach outing
  to the Outer Banks, and a 20th anniversary trip to London and Ireland.
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.
