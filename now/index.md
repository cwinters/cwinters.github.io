## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Updating our [amazing app](https://revisionassistant.com) to work with
  Python3. Finally time.
* Leaning into improving our QA processes and tools. A lot of this would fall
  in the realm of "DevOps stuff" and I'm wary of becoming a Local Jenkins
  Expert. But tool building is pretty satisfying, as is (hopefully) leveling up
  multiple disparate teams.
* Lots more management stuff like planning, staging projects, and thinking a
  quarter or two ahead about impact, trying to balance a couple different
  teams.

__Life__

* Thinking about my role in our unjust society, and what I can do to help.
  (Beyond donating to a number of orgs. There are so many doing great work!)
* Bummed about missing two vacations this year: a standard summer beach outing
  to the Outer Banks, and a 20th anniversary trip to London and Ireland.
* Still [making lots of bread and other baked goods](https://instagram.com/cwinterspgh),
  though I'm no longer posting photos of every bake because it feels weird with
  so much other stuff going on.
* Summertime means [bike time](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31922104).
  Preferred trails are the Panhandle and Montour.
* Learning to live with a teenager and the roller-coaster emotions she contains
  and inspires.
