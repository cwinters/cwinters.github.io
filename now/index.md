## What I'm doing now

__Work__

* Learning about being a manager and the different growing pains a very small
  organization feels when growing into a slightly larger one.
* Monitoring, supporting, and scaling Docker with
  [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
* Breaking down a small-but-monolithic application into microservices

__Life__

* [Odyssey of the Mind](http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/). Barb and I are
  coaching a team at Washington Elementary for the first time. The competition
  is in March (soon!) and things probably aren't moving as quickly as we'd like,
  but the girls are having fun and there's not too much drama.
* Running better. I've half-assed some longer runs in the past, which is
  probably a bad idea for someone my age. Initial results are good - I recently
  cut a [minute-per-mile](http://results.xacte.com/?id=1144&tagcode=3499) off my
  previous two outings. But I still have loads of room for improvement.
* Exercising regularly. Toward running better I recently joined the Y and go to the
  [PNC](http://www.ymcaofpittsburgh.org/locations/pnc-ymca/) branch three days
  a week, modulo weird events. This also involves learning (currently on my
  own) to swim, which is going very, very slowly.
