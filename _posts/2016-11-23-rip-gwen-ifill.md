Every time I saw Gwen Ifill on PBS or moderating a debate I was impressed by
Gwen Ifill. She seemed to embody the best of journalism -- uncowed by power,
eyes on the prize of truth, not settling for either the easy questions or
brush-off answers.

[This is a lovely article](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/talking-to-young-people-about-trump-with-lessons-from-gwen-ifill)

about her, drawing connections between her career and young people today who
can lack the context of history and the understanding that people are not
simply collections of positions and biases.

In particular, the last sentence here is something I aspire to.

> Gwen and I both loved clothes, but we loved the armor we wore even before we

> newsroom she inhabited, unabashedly but gently providing good information that
> helped cause hateful words or hateful glances to fall to the ground and dry up.
