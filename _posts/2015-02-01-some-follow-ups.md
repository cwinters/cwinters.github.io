## Easier waffles

[These waffles](/2015/01/25/making-waffles.html) were delicious, but required a
big time investment, and their fussiness indicates to me that they're fairly
sensitive to variation. (8 1/2 TB of butter? So use that whole stick, then bust
open another one so you can shave off 1/16 of it for that extra another half
tablespoon. Fussy.)

On top of all that the cleanup was fussy too. I wound up heating up the iron
again then dredging up some of the big pools of carmelized sugar with Q-Tips.
Annoying.

Fortunately there are many recipes under the sun. The waffle iron came with a
few, including [this one](http://www.food.com/recipe/good-night-waffles-202843)
that someone replicated online. It's also a night-before recipe, but it's one
that takes only 10 minutes and has only one rise (overnight). Here's what the
dough looks like the next morning:

They're a more traditional batter so cooking isn't quite so tricky either. The
results are excellent -- just a little bit of sweet, and balanced between
doughy and airy. So I think the reward-to-effort ratio is higher than the other
ones, though it's certainly possible that with practice (and maybe a stand
mixer) the effort for the Li&egrave;ge waffles will diminish.

## New podcast: Invisibilia

A new podcast that started [since my last review](2014/11/06/podcasts-again.html) is 
[Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/). It's set a very high
bar for itself with the first few episodes not only in production quality and
storytelling, but in presenting me with moments that make me question
fundamental things.

For example, the most recent episode
([Entanglement](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/382451600/entanglement?showDate=2015-01-30))
talked at one point about humans' ability to mirror one another, unconsciously.
Small things like physical mannerisms, ways of speaking, even autonomic
processes like breathing. But also large parts of our identity -- how we
interact with others, our emotional states.

And two psychologists came to the realization that treating people is even
harder than they'd previously thought because of these entanglements. In fact
the very notion of you as an individual gets called into question because
you're a constantly changing amalgam of your environment, as is everyone around
you.

There are definitely some WTF moments when they're explaining unusual
conditions that people have, but they don't leave it at that and dig into what
those conditions illustrate. Wonderful stuff, and something that __everyone__
can get something out of.
