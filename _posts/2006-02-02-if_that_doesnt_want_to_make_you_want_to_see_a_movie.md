<p>From the latest <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2006/02/02/btm/">Beyond the Multiplex</a>:</p>
 
<blockquote>The script by David Diamond is wildly uneven, but Mr. McDermott and Mr. Dogg (as the New York Times would put it) make a compelling combo, even when the movie they're in appears to be "Barton Fink" mixed with "The Shining" and "Do the Right Thing."</blockquote>
