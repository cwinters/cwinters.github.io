title: "Lameness of media, part 839"
---



A recent <a href="http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2004/10/18/tomo/index1.html">This Modern World cartoon</a> does more to illuminate the lameness of the media than any number of Sunday morning tut-tut post-mortems from a panel of journalists promising they'll do better next time...  I keep thinking we're making normal the realm once previously only occupied by <a href="http://www.religion.emory.edu/faculty/lipstadt.html">historians</a> battling the Holocaust deniers.
