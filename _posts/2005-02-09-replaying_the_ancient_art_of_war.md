title: "Replaying the Ancient Art of War"
---



With <a href="http://www.holwegner.com/software/">this implementation of DOSBox</a> and <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/game.php?ID=404">the download from here</a>, I can play a beloved 20 year-old DOS game (Ancient Art of War) on my Powerbook. Sometimes I really do like technology.
