<p>During my walk to work I was mentally going through the places we visited in Greece last year (photos coming soon, honest) and for some reason I couldn't remember the place where <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Lion_Gate.html">this gate</a> is. I could remember the <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Treasury_of_Atreus.html">treasury building</a> nearby and <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Theater_at_Epidauros.html">this theater</a> about a half-hour away, but not the famous place itself. What's good at getting rid of that kind of block?</p>
