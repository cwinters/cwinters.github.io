<p>I saw <a href="http://kdka.com/bios/local_bio_053110714/">Ken Rice</a> (or at least his doppleganger) trundling through a Giant Eagle this past weekend. He looked <b>exactly</b> like he does on TV, except he was wearing a baseball cap. I have the vague sense that this onscreen/real-life similarity is truer for male newsfolks than for female, but have only one or two sampling points to support my theory.</p>
