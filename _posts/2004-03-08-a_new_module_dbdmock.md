title: "A new module: DBD::Mock"
---



A little while ago I <a href="/2004/01/11/mock_frameworks_in_perl.html">posted</a> about the need for a mock database driver in Perl. Well, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Mock/">DBD::Mock</a> has now hit the CPAN with actual tests and docs, which are <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Mock/DBD/Mock.pm">pretty good</a> I think, especially for a module that has a fairly limited set of use cases.

<p>Now that I think of it, it's probably easier to write documentation for a component that has limited uses. You can cover a significant portion (where 'significant' approaches 100%) of how people will use it and thus deal with the examples and pitfalls concretely one by one rather than abstractly. The concrete part is the trick -- I don't know anyone who learns better from abstractions than examples.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my opensource documentation I'm trying to be much better about using examples to illustrate what's going on and how to use a module. Code and/or configuration speaks quite loudly in matters like this.</p>
