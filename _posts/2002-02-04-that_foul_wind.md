title: "That foul wind"

Couldn't even make it into work today -- sometime last night a thin sheet of ice just popped down over the city, and for some reason the local government decided to ignore it. While waiting for the bus one of the folks there said a bus had come by earlier, but it was packed. And while the bus made it up the street, it didn't do so in a straight line. That's enough for me to say "no mas", walk home and setup a working Java environment on my home machine so I can do some work at home.
