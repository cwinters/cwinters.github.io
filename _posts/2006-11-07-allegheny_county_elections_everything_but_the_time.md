<p>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.county.allegheny.pa.us/elect/">Allegheny County Elections Division</a> for having a website with information about voting machines, how to cast provisional and absentee ballots, and even a link to the results for today.</p>

<p>But what's one of the most common pieces of information people might want? <b>What time do the polls open?</b> Can you find it? Me either. Grrrrrrr....</p>
