title: "JIRA 2.2 released!"

<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/news/archives/000174.jsp#000174">Announcement</a> - Quick on the heels of 2.1 comes a bunch of small but very useful new features. I haven't tried it out yet (we should go into production with it the next couple of days) but all our old data imports okay and custom workflows are implmented without a hitch. I doubt anything will break :-)
