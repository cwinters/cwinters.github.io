title: "You might think Chi Chi's is funny..."

From <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">NTK</a> comes <a href="http://www.six-something.org/projectbritney.php">this honeypot</a> of Britney Spears queries, but about halfway down is: "Britney Spears enjoying a Meal at Chi-Chis." Normally this is no big deal, but when you combine it with the <a href="http://post-gazette.com/pg/03318/239715.stm">recent Hepetitis A outbreak</a> from a local Chi Chi's it's a little different, eh? Maybe she can <a href="http://post-gazette.com/pg/03318/239713.stm">help their image</a> -- like I needed the 'experts' to tell me that. (And Britney, we can take care of the "running naked through an abandoned steel mill" thing locally as well, got lots of 'em...)
