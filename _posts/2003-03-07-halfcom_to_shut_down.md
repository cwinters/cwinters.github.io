<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/wire/2003/03/07/ebay/index.html">EBay plans to shut down Half.com unit</a> - Someone buy <a href="http://half.ebay.com/account/functions/view_seller.cfm?function=view_seller_item.cfm&seller_id=619980&inv_meta=1&pagenum=1">all my books</a> before this happens! (It looks like you've got about 18 months, so start saving.) Otherwise I'll have to get an amazon.com account and move everything over there...
