title: "TV out of campaigns"
---



<a href="http://www.soletta.com/2003/05/05.html#a168">Real Campaign Finance Reform</a> - Ross has an idea: "Ban TV advertising as a part of campaigns." I think it's a great idea not only because it's impossible to say anything meaningful in 30 seconds but it might force people to actually <b>read</b> about the people who are running their lives. (I am an optimist.) I sometimes wonder if people are merely apathetic or if we do not <b>want</b> to care because caring would force us into doing something about our current intolerable situation.
