<p>GLYASDI - God Loves You And So Do I</p>

<p>I can't imagine ever being in an email/IM conversation where someone would use this. I can imagine <b>hearing</b> it from someone who is trying to convert me from my heathen ways. But email? Doesn't having an acronym for this cheapen the sentiment? Are future missionaries just going to blanket people in "backward" countries with emails saying that god loves them?</p>

<p>(Found at <a href="http://netforbeginners.about.com/library/101/acronyms/bl-acronyms101.htm">one</a> of the billion acronym dictionaries, looking up entries for our work wiki since certain coworkers haven't heard of certain common ones...)</p>
