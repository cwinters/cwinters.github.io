If you haven't heard it before 
[The Incomparable](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) 
is a great podcast about geeky consumables: comics, books, movies, TV, games. Sometimes they review
[a single movie](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/190/),
and sometimes they do really entertaining drafts of
[characters](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/58/) or
[movies](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/79/) to form a new show or idea.

That they're reviewing media also means that typical episodes are removed from
the constraints of keeping up with the daily stream. You can listen (and re-listen) to the 
[Raiders](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/8/) 
episode with no idea that it was recorded four years ago. Some episodes I save
for many months until I read or watch what they're talking about, because I
know that whatever the mix of panel they'll always have something insightful
and funny to say.

I'm pretty sure there's some sort of magic involved for the people to be able
to watch and read so much and have lives -- with jobs and spouses and kids,
even! Do they live in a hotel with room service? I feel like I'm decently
disciplined with my time and getting through podcasts during commuting and
housework, plus a book or two a week, is a lot. And that's with zero movies or
TV.

Anyway, there are a few things I'd love for them to talk about. In no
particular order:

__1.__ Harry Dresden books by Jim Butcher. I've been re-reading these recently
and I think there's a wealth of meaty things to talk about. Free will, change
over time, the consequences of choices large and small, trust in others,
corruption of power, and much more.

The only problem is that at this point in the series there are a **lot** of
books (the [most recent](http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Dresden-Files-Book-ebook/dp/B00HUVUSZ4/) 
is the 15th), and if they were going to talk about the series I think most of them
would want to read them all. Big investment, but worth it.

__2.__ Along similar lines the Dark Tower books by Stephen King represent
another mountain.  I was really into these for a while, and still hold the
first three in high esteem. But the fourth was okay and I dropped off after a
while. And then one day I picked up the last book in a bookstore, intending to
finish the series.  Idly flipping through I found a drawing of what looked like
King, read around there, put the book down and refused to invest any more time
in it. (No spoilers, not even sure if that qualifies though.)

That said, I know John Siracusa has read them all and probably has a lot to
say. He could definitely sway me to pick them back up.

__3.__ Coen Brothers movies. I'm pretty sure they've mentioned Fargo, and
possibly others, but I feel like the whole body is worthy of an hour or two. The recent 
[overview](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/category/30-years-of-coens) is a
good jumping off point.

__4.__ Revisiting Locke and Key. Episode [126](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/126/)
turned me on to the comic, and I'm incredibly grateful for it because I think
it's one of the best series I've read. But it came out while the series was
still going on.  Hearing them talk about the arc and finale of the series and
characters would be great.

__5.__ A few authors - Brian K. Vaughan and Greg Rucka. They've talked about
Vaughan a bit with the [Saga episode](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/154/)
but I'd love to hear them discuss [Y: The Last Man](https://www.comixology.com/Y-The-Last-Man/comics-series/475) 
or [Ex Machina](https://www.comixology.com/Ex-Machina/comics-series/245). And Greg Rucka
touches a lot of different genres in both comics and novels. And he's written a
number of comics with strong female leads -- 
[Stumptown](https://www.comixology.com/Stumptown/comics-series/3444), 
[Lazarus](https://www.comixology.com/Lazarus/comics-series/10378), and 
[Queen & Country](https://www.comixology.com/Queen-Country/comics-series/1162) -- 
the last of which is a series of novels as well.

__UPDATE__ - [@theincomparable](http://twitter.com/theincomparable/) graciously
[pointed out](https://twitter.com/theincomparable/status/511922214065553408) 
that a Brian K. Vaughan episode 
[already exists](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/54/)!
