title: "New Powerbook has arrived"
---



My <a href="/2003/10/28/dropped_the_hammer_on_the_powerbook.html">new Powerbook</a> has finally arrived, and everything so far has worked great. No white spots, no latch problems, Airport range seems fine (40 feet away from a D-Link 624 and I'm getting three bars). It even came pre-installed with Panther so I don't need to deal with any upgrade issues. More impressions of using this as I go -- I even created a new category for these so they don't clutter up my 'pristine' feed for those picky java.blogs folks...
