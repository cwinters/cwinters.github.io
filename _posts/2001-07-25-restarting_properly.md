title: "Restarting properly"
---



<p>Note to self: after upgrading your X server and fonts
(say, from 4.0.x to 4.1.x to get DRI working properly so you
can play Quake 3 b/c you're a lazy bastard and don't feel
like working), it's helpful to stop and restart the font
server. Otherwise all the fonts come up as squares, which
can tax your memory as to option positioning. (It's kind an
of interesting usability test, tho.)

<p>I wish I were in <a
href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/">San Diego</a>
right now. I should make a resolution to either be with a
stable company next year around this time or make sufficient
money that I can go out there and justify the (large)
expense.
