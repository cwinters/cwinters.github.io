<p>(At least for me.) When you become a parent, many stories you
hear about kids just cut through all your cynicism callouses and
hit your emotional core in nothing flat. 
<a href="http://www.prx.org/pieces/37745-moth-radio-hour-1">This
story</a> from Anthony Griffith just had me crying in a public
place.</p>

<p>I am not a praying person. But I do recognize my immense good
fortune, and I'm thankful for it.</p>
