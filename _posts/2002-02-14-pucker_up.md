I am not a Microsoft basher. But <a href="http://salon.com/tech/feature/2002/02/14/dot_net/index.html">this article on Salon</a> on how .net is going to save us all is one of the worst ass-kissing pieces I've ever read on that site. I half expected the piece to end with, "If you're not using Visual Studio .Net then the terrorists have already won." Maybe they need a spike in their adviews from all the /. folks sure to read it with clenched teeth...
