If there's anyone out there who doesn't have a gmail invite and wants one, shoot me an email. If you don't know or can't find my email, maybe you should stick to POP3...

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: No more comments! I am entirely out of invites, and you people can't seem to follow instructions anyway...</p>
