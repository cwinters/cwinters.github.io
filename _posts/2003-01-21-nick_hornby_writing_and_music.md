title: "Nick Hornby writing and music"

<a href="http://www.powells.com/news/features/hornby_songbook.html">Nick Hornby's "Songbook"</a> - Not only is Hornby a great reviewer, but his <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/product?isbn=1573228214">books</a> are funny and smart without being pretentious. And anything that <a href="http://www.powells.com/features/songbook/ch2_pg15.html">discusses "Thunder Road"</a> so earnestly has won a place on my wishlist. (BTW: I think the piano version on the live box set from the mid-80s is the best I've heard.)
