Here is a perfect counter example to the <a href="/2002/09/01/show_me_the_code.html">JAXB nonsense</a> I posted about yesterday. On this page you'll get a two-paragraph overview. One of the links along the side ('Detail') gives you a handful of scenarios along with code examples. The FAQ is also quite helpful. With all this, I can figure out in less than five minutes whether this is appropriate for me. (It turns out that it was really simple to bolt this onto the existing framework using the excellent <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>, but that's beside the point.)
