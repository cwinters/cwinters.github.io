<p>
The <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~golder/dialect/index.html">overview</a> of the study is fairly interesting, although putting it on the web has likely diminished its value. In any case, my fellow Pittsburghers will probably be most interested in the <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~golder/dialect/staticmaps/q_50.html">results</a> of the question: "What word(s) do you use to address a group of two or more people?"  - 'yins' comes in at a measly 0.37%. I'm not sure to whom that respondent in the middle of Texas is saying it, however...
