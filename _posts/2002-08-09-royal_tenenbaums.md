<p>Finally saw this movie. Liked it a lot. Fantastic acting all around, although I thought Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were mostly types. Amazing soundtrack -- not in the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120888">Wedding Singer</a> or <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086525">Valley Girl</a> sense where it musically captures a period in time. Just that the music fits comfortably with and illuminates the scene very well.
