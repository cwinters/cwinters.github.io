title: "Taking responsibility"

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44176-2003Jan11.html">Bush Administration Shifts Blame for N. Korea Crisis</a> - I don't know about you, but when a news story begins "A senior Foo administration official suggested yesterday...", there isn't a grain of salt large enough for me to take the rest of the article seriously. So much for taking responsibility.
