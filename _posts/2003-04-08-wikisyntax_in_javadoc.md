title: "WikiSyntax in Javadoc"
---



<a href="http://www.jhorman.org/wikidoclet/">wikidoclet</a> - I don't normally repost entries I find useful from other javablogs, but <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/04/08.html#a15">Rod's post</a> pointing out this tool struck a nerve. Using WikiSyntax in Javadoc sounds fantastic! I already find myself inadvertently using it in emails and elsewhere, so this furthers the process by which nearly everything I type will be wikified. Next step: using it in <a href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlpod.html">POD</a>...
