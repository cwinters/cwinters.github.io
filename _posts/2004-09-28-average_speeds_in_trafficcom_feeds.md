<a href="http://www.traffic.com/Pittsburgh-Traffic/Pittsburgh-Traffic-Reports.html">Pittsburgh Traffic Reports</a> - I hate that I have to care about this, but I just noticed that the RSS incident feeds from traffic.com now have average speeds in the description, as in:

<pre>
Parkway West from the Airport to the Fort Pitt Tunnel
 * ...
 * jammed Green Tree to Ft. Pitt Tunnel - Avg 
   speed at Pkwy Center: 6 mph
</pre>
