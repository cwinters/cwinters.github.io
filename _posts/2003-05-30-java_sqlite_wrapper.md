title: "Java SQLite wrapper"
---



An enterprising soul has created a <a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite/">Java interface</a> for the lightweight <a href="">SQLite</a> database. SQLite isn't rocket science, but it's a very fast file-based, cross-platform, cross-language database extremely useful for getting something running quickly. The next version of OpenInteract uses it in the unit testing suite to create a website along with all its data.
