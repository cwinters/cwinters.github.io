A quick search will find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=brooks+%22show+me+your+tables%22">plenty of references</a> for the classic Brooks quote:

<blockquote>
Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables and I won't usually need your flowchart, it'll be obvious.
</blockquote>

<p>I think substituting 'messages' for 'tables' preserves the meaning while bringing it forward into what seems to becoming a service-driven era. Guy Steele <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveNotFailedNarr.html">did something similar</a> a few years ago, except specifying object interfaces instead. Too much coupling, messages work better :-)</p>
