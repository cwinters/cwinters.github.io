title: "New PB memory working perfectly"

<p>The 1GB I picked up from Crucial a few weeks ago has been performing flawlessly in my 15" Aluminum Powerbook with 10.4. I had <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/3371">issues</a> with other third party memory and 10.4 (the computer refused to start), so this is a big relief. Highly recommended.</p>
