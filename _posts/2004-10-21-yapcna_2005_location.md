<a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC 2005</a> - How did I miss the announcement that <b>Toronto</b> was chosen? This is great! I've only been to Toronto once (in 1995 for an American Planning Association conference) but absolutely loved it, so I'm looking forward to getting back. Plus I know Rich Dice will put on a top-notch conference.
