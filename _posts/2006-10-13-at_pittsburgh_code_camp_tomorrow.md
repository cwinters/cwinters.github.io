title: "At Pittsburgh Code Camp tomorrow"
---



Tomorrow I'll be at Pitt attending the <a href="http://www.pittjug.org/CodeCamp.jsp">Pittsburgh Code Camp</a>, a day-long set of practical talks about Java. And it's free! Maybe I'll see you there? (I might bring my camera like I did for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cwinters/sets/72157594297926415/">PPW</a>.)
