title: "No extra password entry with Samba 3.0"
---



<a href="http://us4.samba.org/samba/samba/whatsnew/samba-3.0.0-pressrelease.html">Samba Team Releases Samba 3.0</a> - Yeah, it's got Active Directory support and is supposedly <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1144289">faster than Server 2003</a> for file serving. But most important for me: the 3.0 servers I'm running on my LAN recognized my Windows XP password for authentication, no extra configuration or password entry required. (I <a href="/2003/03/18/xp_annoyances.html">bitched</a> about this a while ago...)
