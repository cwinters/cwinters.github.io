One of my favorite podcasters (and people) is Merlin Mann. But I haven't
actually been listening to a lot of his podcasts recently -- I have such a
backlog, and Back to Work, as enjoyable as it is, tends to rehash many
topics it's covered in the past.

I still subscribe, and I'll listen if an episode looks interesting, or if I'm just pining
for Merlin. Such was the case with
[Episode 202](http://5by5.tv/b2w/202), which I think should enter the canon of
episodes with which you can bring new people into the show. Sure, you get stuff
about Legos and parenting (which I dig, but understand that some don't) but the
last half hour about multitasking and distraction and master is gold. Gold!

They start getting into it around 49:30, entering with a reference
to [a recent article](https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-cost-of-continuously-checking-email)
about email and its effects. Then they really get going into multitasking. Some
brief notes about the discussion:

__1.__ There are different ways of doing multiple things at once. Merlin brings up
the analogy of cooking: first you're browning some ground beef, then you put
water on to boil, then you chop and saute onions. It's possible to do all of
these things at once and most people wouldn't say that it's multitasking (maybe
because you're doing all these things with a common purpose? or because it's
domestic work?). But that's because they're qualitatively different
activities -- they can be set in motion and then left alone for periods of
time. And doubtless you have tasks in your job like this, but...

__2.__ ...most of the time you don't. Writing an email during a meeting is the kind
of bad multitasking -- there's nothing that can be left alone for a period of
time, you need to be thinking about both things and once. And you just can't.

__3.__ Not only can you not do that, but people notice that you can't. In another
great analogy he says multitasking is like "French kissing and driving, you
might think you're doing it well until you ask other people"
(paraphrase).

__4.__ Dan gets hung up on talking about _why_ we do these things -- if we have so
much to do how can we possibly get distracted so easily? Merlin observes that
little rewards combined with little movements are incredibly addictive: move
this gem, fill in this number, write this tweet, like this photo. We're all
like the slot machine junkies. And while it's certainly easier to be distracted
now than ever, it's always been possible for people to find distraction.
(Another great phrase from this part: "You never have to set a reminder to
masturbate.")

__5.__ At some point Merlin brings up flow, and a grid of challenge vs skill --
low challenge and high skill means boredom or relaxation, high challenge and
low skill means anxiety, etc. It's a great way to think of what might be
motivating (or failing to motivate) you.

Later along these lines he brought up the analogy of a water starting a new
job -- everything is difficult, even pouring coffee because you can't take
anything for granted. I totally feel this in my new job -- new domain, new
language, new frameworks, new people. (I even mentioned
[yesterday](/2015/01/07/til-aggregate-and-aws.html) the need to push back
against comfortable solutions.) Very few things are easy right now, which I
think makes it even harder to multitask. But I find the idea very appealing
that you can multitask more the more you learn and master your tools and
problemset and domain. That it's possible for you to set things in motion and,
like browning the beef, leave them be because you know how things will turn
out.

__6.__ In addition to all that, and their charming selves, there's also a briefer
discussion earlier in the show about clutter management that's great. I
couldn't help but think of my sister when Merlin was talking about
[Peter Walsh's book](http://www.amazon.com/Its-All-Too-Much-Living-ebook/dp/B000N2HCP6/)
and how much (or little) meaning she could have possibly found in all her
stuff, and how much was missing elsewhere in her life.
