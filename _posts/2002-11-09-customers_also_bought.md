Jon Udell points out some of the interesting <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/cleanUnderwear.JPG">personalization recommendations</a> from Amazon on his book.

<p>BTW, I consider <em>Practical Internet Groupware</em> essential reading for anyone creating web applications. It doesn't teach you to implement them a certain way, it teaches you to think about them in a way that's stood the test of time (the book was published three years ago) and adapted smartly to rapidly changing technology.</p>
