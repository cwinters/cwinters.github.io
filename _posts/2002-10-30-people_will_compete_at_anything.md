<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/dining/30PELM.html">Big Eaters, Sure, but This Is Absurd</a> - I wasn't going to post this, but then I read this quote toward the end of the article:

<blockquote> Whether Mr. Kobayashi actually consumed that final half [hot dog] has been debated by experts, including Gersh Kuntzman, a reporter for The New York Post and self-styled Homer of the eating contest. "I've gone back to the videotape," Mr. Kuntzman said. "He did exhale the last half, but then he reinhales it through his nostrils which, again, is such a mark of a champion."</blockquote>
