Son of a bitch! After upgrading to Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Firebird</a> 0.7 there's a damned 'Close Other Tabs' entry in the context-sensitive menu. I've bitched about this <a href="/2003/04/07/moz_tabs_aggravation.html">multiple</a> <a href="/2003/10/08/kicking_mozilla_to_the_curb.html">times</a> <a href="http://chris.hates-software.com/2003/08/14/f70b5327.html">earlier</a> and was overjoyed that this insidious choice was eliminated. But it's back! And I can't easily configure it out of existence! Dammit!
