title: "JUnit 4 apparently out "
---



<p>It looks like JUnit 4 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278">is out</a>, although <a href="">its home</a> doesn't mention it... odd. Requires Java 5 as it uses annotations, should be interesting to compare to TestNG. Must read this <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-junit4.html">doc</a> about it sometime.</p>
