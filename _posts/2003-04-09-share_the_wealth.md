<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/09/opinion/09CLEM.html">Sharing, Alaska-Style</a> - Setting up a system where the people of Iraq, rather than Halliburton or other campaign contributors, profit from their nation's resources would give them a stake in its stability and raise the standard of living for everyone, which is probably the smartest anti-terrorist measure we can take. Makes sense to me.
