</a> - Looks like I might have been a little hasty in <a href="/2002/08/17/tarred_with_the_wide_brush.html">depicting</a> efforts to tenuously associate a Jeb Bush appointee with a paper. Turns out there's more papers around on welfare, sexual education, how the "breakdown in traditional sex roles" is harming families, and other topics The appointee had a more direct hand in authoring them. Also lame is the Jeb Bush attempt to portray this as anti-Christian rather than accept that people may have disagreements with what this guy believes, regardless of his religion. Does everyone need to be a victim? (Via <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/conason/2002/09/10/bush/index.html">Conason's journal</a>)
