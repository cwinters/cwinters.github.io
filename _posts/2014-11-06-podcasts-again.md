Yesterday a couple of my [new](/2014/10/30/starting-another-new-job.html) coworkers
were talking about podcasts and what they should listen to. And that reminded me that
I haven't updated my 
[Summa post on podcasts](http://www.summa-tech.com/blog/2014/01/14/keeping-up-with-podcasts)(1)
for almost a year. So let's make a diff.

## Changes

Reading back over that list a few things have changed.

1. [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) is 
no longer on Mule Radio, moving into Gruber's Daring Fireball house.
2. [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) used to have an RSS feed so you
didn't have to use iTunes, but not so anymore. You can listen online but
downloading requires iTunes.
3. [The Incomparable](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) is
also on its own now, and part of [a whole family](http://www.theincomparable.com/)
of like-minded shows.

## Additions

Some new things have drifted in as well.

1. [Exponent](http://exponent.fm/) - After ATP (and sometimes before) this is
   my favorite technology-related podcast. Ben Thompson (who writes
   [Stratechery](http://stratechery.com/)(2)) and James Allworth talk about
   the technology landscape, mostly from an economics standpoint. Both are
   very sharp, but one of the unique things I love is that they have 
   **genuine arguments**, and sometimes they even change each other's mind!
2. [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) - Sara Koenig from This American Life
   focuses on a single story for as many weeks as it takes. The first story
   is about a 15 year-old murder, and you don't really know how it's going to end.
3. [Startup](http://hearstartup.com/) - Alex Blumberg from This American Life
   and Planet Money is starting a company to create podcasts, this is the process.
   There was an episode (3?) where he decided to find a co-founder. Once
   he did, he then had to figure out how much of the company to give him.
   The moment when he did was way more emotional than I can convey.
4. [On Being](http://www.onbeing.org) is one I've downloaded recently -- specifically,
   the episodes with [Yo-Yo Ma](http://www.onbeing.org/program/yo-yo-ma-music-happens-between-the-notes/6641)
   and [Bobby McFerrin](http://www.onbeing.org/program/catching-song-bobby-mcferrin/249) -- but haven't listened to yet.

## Noteworthies

1. Software Engineering Radio had a couple of great recent episodes 
   ([209](http://www.se-radio.net/2014/08/episode-208-randy-shoup-on-hiring-in-the-software-industry/) 
     and [212](http://www.se-radio.net/2014/10/episode-212-randy-shoup-on-company-culture/))
   with Randy Shoup on hiring and company culture.
2. SE Radio also had a great (as usual) recent one with 
   [Stefan Tilkov](http://www.se-radio.net/2014/09/episode-210-stefan-tilkov-on-architecture-and-micro-services/)
3. Dan North had [another good presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/craftsmanship-programmer)
   on mastery.
4. Martin Fowler was [on the Ruby Rogues](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler) 
   recently talking about refactoring.

(1) Sorry for the formatting on that where the links are impossible 
to see, out of my control.

(2) You should subscribe to this. Ben is a great writer and a perceptive
synthesizer. And I think the model -- giving money directly to people so they
can think and write -- is going to be the more sustainable and trustworthy one
going forward.
