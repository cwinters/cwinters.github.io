This article (linked from /.) gives the misleading impression that SourceForge is going to be deployed on WebSphere. However, the <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html">VA press release</a> says that SF will run on DB2 and make WebSphere part of the compile farm. Big difference.
