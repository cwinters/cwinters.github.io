I think when people tell me how much better Java is than Perl I'll point them to <a href="/images/superlong_java_error_message.png">this</a>.  (Sorry Rickard :-)  While I'm in the 13 year-old boy mindset I might as well point out <a href="/images/netwide_ass.png">this clip</a> of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/foundry/perl-foundry/">Perl Foundry</a> page at Sourceforge (look at the entry toward the bottom) and something to serve <a href="http://www.poopreport.com/">all your scat needs</a>.
