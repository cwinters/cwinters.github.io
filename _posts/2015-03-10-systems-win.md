From
[A Spreadsheet Way of Knowledge](https://medium.com/backchannel/a-spreadsheet-way-of-knowledge-8de60af7146e),
Steven Levy, originally published in November 1984 Harper's:

> ...The spreadsheet user has no way of quantifying a corporate tradition or
> the misery of stockholders or whether the headaches of a drawn out takeover
> bid will ultimately harm the corporate climates of the firms involved.
>
> The flexibility of spreadsheets can encourage other heartless moves from
> headquarters. It is no great drain on an executive’s time to experiment with
> all sorts of odd, even insidious. He might ask “What if we dropped our
> pension plan?” Then he might run his idea through a spreadsheet and find a
> huge gain in capital- and there would be an unthinkable, in hard figures.

> I remembered the first time I saw a system infect its owner... The company's

> surprised me.

> ...But just after we ordered dessert, Mr. Banner leaned over to me and asked,
> "Can you keep track of keystrokes?"...
>
> "I don't know offhand. But why? Why would you want to do that?"...
>
> "Well, take Mary. I'd like to know everything that Mary does in a day."
>
> Mary was the receptionist and general office manager. She was [the owner's]
> oldest employee, twenty-six years. As I recalled, Mary knew every one of the
> company's clients by name. For the first several years of her employment,
> when [the owner's] kids were small, she used to pick them up from school,
> take them home, and pour them milk.
>
> "But why do you want to keep an eye on Mary? She's doing very well with the
> system. I mean, is there a problem?"
>
> "Oh, no. No problem," said [the owner], "but, you know ... Well, I'm just
> curious. All those years she's been out running things, and now I can find
> out exactly what she does."
>
> "So you want to know about Mary just because you can?" I asked....
>
> "Hmm. That's it, I supposed. The way I look at it, I've just spent all this
> money on a system, and now I get to use it the way I'd like to."...
>
> The system was installed, it ran, and it spoke to him: you can know every
> little thing you always wanted to know. You can keep an eye on the woman you
> trusted to pick up your kids from kindergarten. You can count every
> keystroke, and you want to count them simply because it's possible. You own
> the system, it's your data, you have power over it; and, once the system
> gives you the power, you suddenly can't help yourself from wanting more.
