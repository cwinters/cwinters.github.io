It's not a done deal yet, but this would be fairly groundbreaking for DC. It's also an example of what concentrating your development around rail stations can give you. (Textbook urban planning stuff, but you'd be surprised how often it's ignored -- hi Fairfax County! -- even for heavy rail stops like Metrorail.)
