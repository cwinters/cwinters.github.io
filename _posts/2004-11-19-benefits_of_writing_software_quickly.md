<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/usa.html">Made in USA</a> - Another essay by Paul Graham. Worth a read. (from <a href="http://del.icio.us/ziggy">ziggy</a>)

<blockquote>In software, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. Better to get a prototype done fast, and see what new ideas it gives you.</blockquote>
