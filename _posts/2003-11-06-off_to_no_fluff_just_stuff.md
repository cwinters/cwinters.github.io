title: "Off to No Fluff Just Stuff"
---



We're shortly off to <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/2003-11-arlington/index.jsp">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> in Arlington, so likely no blogging until Sunday at the earliest. I was disappointed to hear that Mike Clark <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2003/11/05#NoMikeAtNoFluff">won't be there</a>, but it should be great despite that. Driving down in a van with six other guys should be... interesting as well. At least the van has a DVD player so we can watch some of the Kevin Smith movies along the way.
