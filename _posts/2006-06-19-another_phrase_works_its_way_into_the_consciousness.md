<p>Searching for one of my favorite phrases from "Office Space" returns more than I expected, even with quotes:</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22no+talent+ass+clown%22"><img src="http://www.cwinters.com/images/blog/no_talent_ass_clown_results.png" alt="'no talent ass clown': 42,000+ hits"
border="0" />
</a>
</p>

<p>A fun exercise would be to find all the people (etc.) named in the results and list them somewhere :-)</p>
