title: "Two rare occurrences"

<p>The First: a political writer admitting <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/may0204.html#052802148am">he changed his mind</a> about something. The fact that it's so rare -- and among politicians, even rarer -- says to me that for all the words from all sides of all issues, very few people of note can ever be persuaded of anything. This is sad, and scary.</p>

<p>The Second: a discussion of a <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/05/29/extreme_programming/index.html">coding  methods</a> on a mainstream (although with an occasional "technical" bent) news site.</p>
