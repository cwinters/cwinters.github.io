I never met <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Hire_Me">Joe Gregorio</a>, but he wrote some good articles on <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/au/225">XML.com</a> on REST (among other topics), he helped author the Atom API, and published a nifty <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">sparkline service</a>. If he doesn't get hired I guess I'll assume he has flaming horns coming out of his head or something equally bizarre.
