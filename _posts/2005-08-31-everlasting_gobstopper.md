<p>Now that Barb's finished the last Harry Potter, she Kim and I were
sitting around talking about who would be the next head of
school. I said, "Maybe it'll be Slugworth, er, Slughorn." Kim laughed,
remembering her <b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</b>.</p>

said no, but then thought again. A quick google found <a
