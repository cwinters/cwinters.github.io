Two weeks ago I posted this:

Weird times. Some folks will be there through mid-December and I sure do wish
them well, along with the company. Even though I was only there just shy of
nine months I learned some new things (Go, payment processing, e-commerce,
Ansible, Docker, MySQL), met some great people, and got to work on some useful
and interesting projects.

ModCloth is fairly well known, and word spread very quickly about layoffs.
[Unfortunately](https://twitter.com/cwinters/status/524315628371320833) many of
the recruiters in the Bay Area missed that a lot of us are in Pittsburgh, so
lots of my responses had firm and unambiguous wording about my desire to stay
in the area.(1)

But I was really fortunate to have solid interest from a few local folks, and
one of the places that impressed me off the bat and never stopped was
[Lightside Labs](http://lightsidelabs.com/). They have a really nifty
technology and are passionate about helping kids learn to write. Their 
next challenge (or set of challenges) is integrating their technology with a company 
([Turnitin](http://turnitin.com/)) that just recently bought them.

I'll join the team as Principal Software Engineer starting tomorrow -- Happy
Halloween! I not only get to learn Python, but I get to work in a domain that
my wife knows quite well (teaching writing).

And the team is growing! There are spots for QA folks, front-end developers,
and designers. Let me know if you're interested!

More soon...

(1) I actually reply to every inquiry I get from recruiters. Sure, there are
terrible and unscrupulous people in the industry. But most of them are just
trying to do a pretty difficult job, and I think it's worth giving them
the benefit of the doubt.
