<a href="http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/jduska/20020930">Joe discusses</a> how open source projects should focus on working code above everything else. I couldn't agree more. All good things flow from working code. Trying to reverse the flow, putting the cart before the horse, is so 90s :-)

<p>I wrote about this a few months ago in <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=177376">one of my better PerlMonks posts</a>.</p>
