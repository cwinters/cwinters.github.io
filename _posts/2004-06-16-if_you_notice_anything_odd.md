title: "If you notice anything odd..."
---



I'm updating the version of OpenInteract2 this site runs on every week or so -- eating my dogfood <em>quickly</em>. So if you notice anything odd please e-mail me -- just chris at this domain name. (I shouldn't even bother hiding the email from spammers...) One kind soul did so when a comment didn't get added properly -- thanks!
