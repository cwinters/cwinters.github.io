<a href="http://www.mcqueeney.com/roller/page/tom/20050319">Rise of the Scripting Language</a> - Reading articles like this makes me think all the Perl people should get together and buy a "Welcome, Java. Seriously"-<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20040831.shtml">type </a> ad. "Dynamic typing can make you more productive? Mixing OO, functional, procedural and other programming styles can make you expressive? Writing less code can lead to fewer bugs? No kidding!"

<p>(BTW: I'm just choosing one of many recent articles about Java + scripting rather than picking on Tom, particularly since he seems interested in discussing the issue rather than slamming this or that technology.)</p>
