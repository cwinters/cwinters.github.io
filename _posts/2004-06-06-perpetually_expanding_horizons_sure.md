title: "'Perpetually expanding horizons?' Sure..."

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19077-2004Jun5.html">An Optimist's Legacy</a> - I haven't written much about politics partly because I've been swamped with work. But also because there's just too much to write/think about. It's exhausting.

<p>I wasn't going to say anything about Reagan but then I saw this column by George Will describing his legacy:</p>

<blockquote>The feeling of foreboding -- the sense of shrunken possibilities -- that afflicted Americans 20 years ago has been banished by a new birth of the American belief in perpetually expanding horizons.</blockquote>

<p>Spoken like someone who doesn't know a soul who's living from paycheck to paycheck, or worried to the bone that they'll get hurt or sick while they're skating along without health insurance for "just a few months". That's not to say that horizons aren't expanding -- the horizons of the corporations (and the men who run them) sucking the life out of humanity are growing day by day.</p>
