<a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nav.nsf/docid/2004090712504306?OpenDocument&src=hot&prod=Norton%20AntiVirus&ver=2005&csm=no&tpre=">Norton AntiVirus 2005 does not support the repair feature. Please uninstall and reinstall.</a> - When is a shortcut more than a shortcut?

<blockquote>This message can happen if you have changed the default location for the Norton AntiVirus shortcuts in the Windows Start Menu....</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you have moved the shortcuts from the default location, then move them back to their original location to fix the problem.</blockquote>

<p>Who knew shortcuts had so much power?</p>
