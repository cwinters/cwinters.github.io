    First, Bastian tested the funky walking on 40 healthy
    people. Sometimes, the treadmill moved their legs in opposite
    directions. Sometimes it moved one leg up to four times faster
    than the other.
<br />
    With a 15-minute session, she essentially retrained them to walk
    with a lurch. No matter how hard they tried to walk normally when
    the session ended, they couldn't for 10 minutes or so -- until
    automatic nerve systems recalibrated themselves again.

<p>There's a reason neuroscientists are interested in people with
brain damage: just like engineering, putting things back together is
awfully interesting. So is rewiring someone's brain, even temporarily,
to take away something they've taken for granted since they were about a year
old.</p>
