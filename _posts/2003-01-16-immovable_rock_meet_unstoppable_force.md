Which of these two will win the hearts of Jerseyfolk? The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2003/01/15/notes011503.DTL">Hummer</a> or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/nyregion/16JERS.html">recent words from the Governor</a>? Trends both recent and longterm point to the former, but I hold out hope.
