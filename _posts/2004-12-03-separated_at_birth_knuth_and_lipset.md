title: "Separated at birth? Knuth and Lipset"
---



I saw a link to [Knuth's letter to Condoleeza Rice](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/rice.html) 
(old, but still useful) from [Eric](http://eric.buzzword.com/2004/12/03#a3742) 
and from there went to his [home page](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/index.html). 
I immediately noticed the similarity with 
[Seymour Martin Lipset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Martin_Lipset), a political scientist I worked 
for as a research assistant. (My first job after college.) These photos don't quite do the 
similarity justice, but you be the judge:
