Interesting article on why Bayesian filtering is the way to go for filtering spam. I'm a statistics idiot, so I can't say either way. His argument of the SpamAssassin score smells of a straw man. If you're interested in programming -- and some LISP-bigotry :-) -- the rest of Graham's site is worth some time if you've never seen it.
