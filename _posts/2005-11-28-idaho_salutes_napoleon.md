<p>From a piece of <a href="http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/dynamite.asp">Idaho legislature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, any members of the House of Representatives or the Senate of the Legislature of the State of Idaho who choose to vote "Nay" on this concurrent resolution are "FREAKIN' IDIOTS!" and run the risk of having the "Worst Day of Their Lives!" </blockquote>
