<p>While reading lots of web services grumblings in recent days I ran across Bruce Eckel's <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=162149">Are Web Services Real?</a> where he talks about his frustrations trying to use a basic FedEx service. In response one of the <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=162149">commenters </a> said:</p>
  
<blockquote>
There's a module on CPAN that handles the actual calls to the FedEx shipping service. This is the url: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jpowers/Business-FedEx-DirectConnect-1.01/DirectConnect.pm#DESCRIPTION">http://search.cpan.org/~jpowers/...</a>
</blockquote>

<p>...and I was not the least bit surprised.</p>
