title: "I'm on CPAN"
---



<p>I feel so special: my very own CPAN id: 
<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?author=CWINTERS">CWINTERS</a>.
Yay! And as my first task,
I uploaded <tt>SPOPS</tt> to CPAN. (OpenInteract might be
a day or three, still some SQL issues to deal with, but
the package management system is looking good.)

<p>Yes, I know it's silly to get excited over this stuff,
but I can't help it. Even more exciting is the idea that
I can get good enough for publishing modules to be 
an everyday thing. If you'd have told me a couple years
ago that I'd be sending something to CPAN I'd have told
you to go smoke some more.

if you want help with moving into a new place in Pittsburgh.
(Seriously!) It's a great place to live!
