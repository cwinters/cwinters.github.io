title: "Managing source for web apps"
---



<a href="http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/fralshamquol">[OTish] Version Control?</a> - This is mostly Perl specific, but lots of good advice on how to manage code for web applications. The original poster asked about version control but it quickly branched out into how to organize projects, how to push/pull changes to many servers at once and how to ensure consistent module versions. It's a long thread, but if you're short of time focus on posts from Rob Nagler, Jesse Erlbaum and Ask.
