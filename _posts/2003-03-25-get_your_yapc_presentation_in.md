title: "Get your YAPC presentation in?"

<a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/cfp.shtml">Today</a> is the deadline - hurry! Or better yet, <b>don't</b> so my talks have a greater chance of being accepted...

<p>BTW: If you haven't been to a YAPC and have the slightest interest in Perl, I highly recommend it. I can't imagine getting more content for the tiny amount of money you put up, and not just talks from shlubs like me either. Many of the major deities show up every year.</p>
