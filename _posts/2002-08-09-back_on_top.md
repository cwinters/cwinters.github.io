<p><em>from the department of shallowness</em></p>

<p>I'm back on top in google! Typing <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22chris+winters%22">"chris winters"</a> into google brings up a fairly substantial list (it's a common name), but I'm back at number one after being dethroned by the Virginia Male Model for a short while. (No, I won't link to him from here to give his site more weight :-)
