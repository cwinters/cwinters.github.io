title: "Burgh Wings and Pizza: A nice surprise"
---



<p>Sunday we went out with some friends to a new place, Burgh Wings and Pizza in Bridgeville. I'd never even heard about it and I figured it was a typical Pittsburgh pizza place: ok pizza, the evil triad of Bud/Bud Light/Coors Light on draft, plus maybe Sam Adams.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Not only was the pizza <b>excellent</b> (thick-crust variety; Barb and I got the roasted vegetable), but they had around 20 beers on tap: a slew of good domestic microbrews along with some Belgians, Guiness, and a few others. Plus tons of varied bottled beers. Recommended.</p>
