title: "Moving right along (framework, webcam)"

Same old stuff. Lots and lots of work on the framework. Security is working transparently. Lots of other cool stuff too. I might have to wait to put the framework on this site until after we get back from Florida, but I might be able to work it in next week.

<p>Most of the rest of this week will be taken up by yapc, which should be excellent. Last year was great, but I was worried about my presentation and, to compound that, I'd actually forgotten the power supply for my laptop. But Barb rescued me, as always.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering, the webcam uses the WinTV combo package from Happauge, which combines a PCI video capture card and a tiny little color camera. It takes a shot every eight seconds right now, although I can configure it to be as often as 1 second. </p>
