title: "Doing in 1993?"

<a href="http://www.beattie.info/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021015#002353">Russell asks</a> what you were doing in 1993. I graduated from college in 1992 and worked as a research assistant and editor for a <a href="http://policy.gmu.edu/fac/f-bio.htm#Lipset">political scientist</a> in the Washington, D.C. area. Low pay, but very educational.
