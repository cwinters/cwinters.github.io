title: "One thing not to do before a presentation"

Just a helpful hint: if you're modifying your slides (or the slide generation mechanism) for a presentation, your chances for screwing something up increase greatly as the time before you need to leave for the presentation approaches. For instance, the directive you use to execute a command and insert the results in your slide may only capture the first line.
