-- B. J. Novak, "Never Fall in Love" from [One More Thing](http://amazon.com/One-More-Thing-Stories-Other-ebook/dp/B00EGMQIIQ/)

This is a fun book, with more hits than misses. I first heard a story from this read
on [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/518/except-for-that-one-thing?act=1).
Lots of laugh-out-loud sections, like this from "Welcome to Camp Fantastic for
Gifted Teens":

> Today, I am a former millionaire living in an air-conditioned apartment not
> far from the historic town of Patchogue, New York. Would I give it all up to
> change places with you, a gifted teen on the cusp of an unforgettable summer
> of priceless, idle pleasures? Of course not. Being a gifted teen is a
> walking, waking nightmare. But perhaps, with some time and effort, you can
> change places with me.

And the initial story, about a rematch between the tortoise and hare from the
fable, has this description of the result:

> Never, in the history of competition -- athletic or otherwise, human or
> otherwise, mythical or otherwise -- has anyone ever kicked anyone's ass by
> the order of magnitude that the hare kicked the ass of that goddamn fucking
> tortoise that afternoon.
