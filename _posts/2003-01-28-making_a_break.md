In a recent cost-cutting move aimed toward reducing most outstanding debts, the Winters/Alsko household has cancelled AT&T Broadband Digital Cable Service. A spokesperson for the household stated that, while the service was acceptable in terms of downtime, "Cable is a luxury, not a utility, adding "There's only so much Law and Order, South Park and censored movies you can watch." The spokesperson also stated that the household is resigned to the fact that pranksters, particularly ones from the workplace, will report them to <a href="http://www.cabletheft.com/">the authorities</a> for a few laughs.
