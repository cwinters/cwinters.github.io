title: "Cheap pizza"

<p>There was an ad on TV last night for some cheap pizza deal (buy one get one for 99 cents or somesuch). And I thought: how can we push the boundaries for assessing the market demand for cheap pizza? I wonder how many pizzas would be sold if the deal was: large pizza with any five toppings for $5, but every 10th pizza sold will have boogers in it.</p>
