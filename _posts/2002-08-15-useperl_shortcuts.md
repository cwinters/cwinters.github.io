title: "use.perl shortcuts"

I just found out (via <a href="http://use.perl.org/~koschei/">koschei's userinfo</a>) about this 'amigos' page that has recent journal entries from all your friends in a single place. (<a href="/my/amigos/">Try it!</a>) I'm kicking myself for not having seen this before. Does everyone else know about this and I'm arriving late to the party? Is there a page on use.perl that lists similar shortcuts?
