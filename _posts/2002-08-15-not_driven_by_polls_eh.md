So <b>now</b> Bush is for fiscal responsibility. I see. We can throw billions upon billions of dollars at a pie-in-the-sky scheme to blow up missiles from the sky, but people suffering from a drought don't get help due to fiscal responsibility. (Another note: why didn't the recent farm bill contain provisions for this sort of thing?)
