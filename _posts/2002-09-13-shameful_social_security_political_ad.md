title: "Shameful social security political ad"
---



<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/sept0202.html#0912021005pm">Josh  talks about</a> an ad running on "black" Kansas City radio stations that calls Social Security a form or "reverse reparations." How bizarre is that? (There's also a good <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/col/spinsanity/2002/09/13/gopac/index.html">Spinsanity article</a> on this in Salon, but you need to be a member to read it.)
