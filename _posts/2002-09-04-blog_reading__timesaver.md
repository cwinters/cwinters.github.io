From <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/2002/09/04.html">this post</a> on Mike's site I found <a href="http://drools.org/">drools</a>, an open-source OO implementation of the Rete algorithm. For some reason, this didn't come up on my radar when I was doing research into this a few months ago and was afraid we'd have to use a commercial engine. It's gold baby, gold!
