title: "What's a WMD anyway?"
---



Food for thought, from <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2070188/">this year-old article</a> quoting <a href="http://www.ceip.org/files/publications/Harigelreport.asp?p=8&PublicationID=630">this report</a>:

<blockquote>The term "weapons of mass destruction" (WMD), used to encompass nuclear (NW), biological (BW), and chemical weapons (CW), is misleading, politically dangerous, and cannot be justified on grounds of military efficiency. ...Whereas protection with various degrees of efficiency is possible against chemical and biological weapons, however inconvenient it might be for military forces on the battlefield and for civilians at home, it is not feasible at all against nuclear weapons.</blockquote>
