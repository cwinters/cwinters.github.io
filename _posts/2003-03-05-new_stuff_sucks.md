title: "New stuff sucks!"

I think it's pretty cool ("cool" as in "amazingly stupid") that Everclear's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008CLIJ/">new album</a> hasn't even come out yet and someone on Amazon is recommending a previous album instead. (What's even better: I blogged about <a href="/2000/07/19/fanboys.html">something similar</a> about two and a half years ago regarding a different Everclear album...)
