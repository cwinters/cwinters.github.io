<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/16622">Re: Perl 6 timeline?</a> - This seemed like a good overview from Larry. I haven't been paying attention at all except for glancing at Piers's <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/02/p6pdigest/20040215.html">summaries</a> from time to time. Don't want to get my hopes up too soon...
