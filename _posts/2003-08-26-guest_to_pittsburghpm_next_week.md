<a href="http://pgh.pm.org/m/20030902.html">Bricolage by David Wheeler</a> - Just in case you're in Pittsburgh, care about Perl and aren't on the mailing list. Bricolage is a really slick content management system. And by CMS I don't mean 'another Slashdot clone', I mean a system where people who <b>publish</b> can manage text, images, video, sound, ads, etc. through different workflows and serve up millions of hits per day. I saw the last half of David's presentation at YAPC::NA -- good stuff. (I dunno why he's using <tt>HTML::Template</tt>, but whatever... &lt;duck&gt;)
