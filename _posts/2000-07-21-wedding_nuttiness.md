<p><a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/schoen/">schoen</a>: having gone through
the "wedding fun" recently, I can totally relate to the
Macy's experience. In fact, the registry is not only for
Macy's, but also all the other Federated department stores
(Burdine's, Lazarus, and a few others that are specific to a
geographic area). And you can get to the same registry
online at <a href="http://weddingchannel.com/">the Wedding
Channel site</a>. Apparently, all these stores get all their
goop from the same warehouse(s). It's funny to think of it,
because Macy's has this <em>New York</em> quality to it, and
Lazarus is just, well, Lazarus.
