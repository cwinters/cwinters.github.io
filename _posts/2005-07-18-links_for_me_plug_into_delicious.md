Just a short note: if you post anything to <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a> you think I might be interested in, add the pseudotag 'for:cwinters' and I'll see it. People taking advantage of this to jam disturbing images into my naive brain (you know who you are) will get a bloody horsehead in their bed, or something.
