title: "IDEA EAP Build 944 released"
---



<a href="http://www.intellij.net/eap/">IntelliJ EAP</a> - The previous build (939) was one of the few that simply failed to work for me: it wouldn't even open my project, only getting to where it scanned some of the internal IDEA classes for caching and at some point swallowing all available memory in about five seconds. Ouch. This version starts up and works fine, although I'm still trying to find how to split an editor window in two and edit two documents at the same time. (One of the big features I miss from emacs...)
