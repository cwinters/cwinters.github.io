title: "Valuable phone context"

<p>I know that even voice response systems that are not state of
the art can tell you, the phone answerer, how long I've been
waiting. So in the interest of treating both of us as human
beings, I think it would be useful to say something like, "Sorry
for making you wait eleven minutes, how can I help you today?"
People who react belligerently to that will do so to anything, so
there's no helping them. We don't all have to be cogs.</p>
