# Is __Wayne's World__ entertaining? No way! Way!

**by Chris Winters**

Near the middle of a consistently funny __Wayne's World__, the evil
capitalist Benjamin (Rob Lowe) tries to convince Garth (Dana Carvey) to sell out
Wayne's World. Garth is geeking out on a mechanical arm and becomes jittery,
then responds to Benjamin's suggestion in a clear, almost robotic voice, "We
fear change." The arm goes nuts, and Garth has to subdue it with a hammer,
pounding it into submission

Not only do Wayne (Mike Meyers) and Garth fear a change from their
strip-cruising/heavy metal-listening/donut-eating existence, but their entire
environment does. One of the highlights of __Wayne's World__ is Aurora,
Ill., a suburb of Chicago formerly mentioned only in the introduction to every "Wayne's
World" skit on Saturday Night Live. Aurora is the perfect suburb.

It's not too rich, not too poor, and it has loads of weird shops, like the
donut shop with the hockey player moving back and forth on the top that Wayne
and Garth frequent - always ordering a half dozen crullers and a jelly donut.
The store owner fiercely ponders adulterous murder, and the store cop is
strangely reminiscent of Ronald Reagan. He, like everyone else in Aurora,
banters with Wayne in Wayne's lingo. "No way," Wayne says; "Way,"
the cop replies. It seems even police watch public-access cable at 10:30 Friday
night.

But more important is the feeling of Aurora, a nameless, purposeless
suburban angst. In the best quote of the film, Wayne says, "I thought I had
mono for an entire year. But it turned out I was just bored " The suburbs
have their own cultural vocabulary which separates them from the city. When
Wayne tries out his dream Stratocaster in the guitar store, he plays the first
few chords of, naturally, "Stairway to Heaven." The assistant stops
him and points to a sign on the wall which says, "NO Stairway to Heaven!"

Wayne introduces himself early on to the camera and audience. He still
lives with his parents and has had an endless series of joejobs," which
have given him an extensive collection of nametags and hairnets We have no idea
what a "joejob" is, but with the inclusion of these two accessories of
minimum-wage hell, we know exactly what he's talking about.

The act of naming in "Wayne's World" is a powerful one; even old
and trite objects become fresh. When Wayne reassures Garth a friend won't puke
in the car, he gives Garth a "No honk guarantee."

The simple plot (Boy meets Girl, etc.) is only a device to get these guys
on the screen. Nothing takes itself seriously in this film, and it's a good
thing. Too much senousity spoils the stew. The acting is all well-done
tongue-in-cheek. Although Cassandra (Tia Carrere) sings well, rocks out and
keeps in the film's spirit, she seems also to have been chosen for her sizable
cleavage, which the camera mercilessly exploits. Rob Lowe hams it up as the
nasty talent scout whose only interests are sex (with Wayne's girlfriend,
Cassandra) and money.

Wayne and Garth, as characters and filmmakers, are deeply familiar with the
conventions of film and do their best to break them at every opportunity. Wayne
has the freedom to open a "KEEP OUT" door in the donut shop to see a
warehouse of jumping and kicking ninjas. "I always wanted to do that,"
he says. When Wayne confronts Cassandra and Benjamin about their relationship,
he goes into a tearful exposition about his crushed manhood while the words "Oscar
Clip" flash on the screen. But when the expected tears don't fall (as they
do in every Oscar scene), Wayne reaches into a pitcher of water, splashes some
on his face and continues. The ending is perfect icing that I can't give away

But what drives __Wayne's World__, what drives so many in the
television era is constant self-reference and a nostalgia for the immediate
past. There are so many borrowed seenes and lines that the movie -- and the
lives of Wayne and Garth -- take on a repetition that seems alniust incestuous.
They live off "Twilight Zone" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" They
zone on the hood of Garth's Pacer (the Mirthmobile) near the airport runway,
and, while waiting for a jumbo jet to fly scant hundreds of feet over their
heads, they "whistle" (even though their lip-synching is purposely
off) just like cowboys used to do in the westerns of their childhood. Wayne
muses about the two "Bewitched" dads (Dick York and Dick Sargent). He
says, "Hey, wait! 'Sargent,' 'York.' 'Sargent York!' Isn't that weird?"
as if finding a new way to split the atom.

Wayne and Garth find meaning in everything, even when it's that same old
filler that means nothing at all. Watching them is always hilarious, but at
times a little disconcerting, hitting a little too close to home.
